# MetaVID-project
## Description:
Developed MetaVID, a PyQt GUI app for video metadata management at Établissement Public de Télévision. It uses FFmpeg to extract metadata (e.g., size, format, date) from videos and stores it in MySQL, allowing users to filter videos by criteria for efficient organization.


it is a personal project and a PyQt-based application for managing and exploring video metadata. This tool allows users to upload video files, extract detailed metadata using FFmpeg, and store the data in a MySQL database. Users can easily filter and search videos by attributes such as file size, creation date, and location.

## Project Overview

MetaVID was developed to simplify the management and exploration of video metadata. With its intuitive interface and robust filtering capabilities, users can quickly find and analyze metadata information for large video collections.

### Key Features

- **Video Upload**: Easily upload video files to extract and store metadata.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Uses FFmpeg to extract detailed metadata, including file size, creation date, location, and more.
- **Database Storage**: Stores metadata in a MySQL database for easy management and retrieval.
- **Search and Filter**: Provides a searchable interface to filter videos based on specific metadata attributes.

## Requirements

To run MetaVID, you’ll need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- FFmpeg
- MySQL server

A `requirements.txt` file will be provided in the future for easy installation of dependencies.
